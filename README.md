## About

This application was built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) to have a hybrid version (multiplatform).

## Built-With

### Stacked
Stacked is a Flutter framework for building production applications. It offers a complete frontend
architecture for our app, and make the code testable and maintainable.

### Hive
Hive is used for local storage, for its speed in both reading and writing.


### Dio + Retrofit
Dio is preferred for all it has to offer. It's pretty complete. It handles server requests, interceptors and transformers.


### Velocity_x
An extension library that speeds development.

### Flutter Gen
This is a library that manages my project's assets, and makes them available in the project as properties of a class. It saves me having to write the full path to an image I want to display, for example.

### Firebase Firestore
For the chat module, Firebase Firestore is the tool of choice, to facilitate real-time functionnality.
